## ⚠️ Warning for Users⚠️
- If you are not a developer and simply want profiles for Cura, do NOT download them from within the GitHub file viewer; or you will get **import errors** when you try to use them.
- Instead, get the .zip package from Releases tab, or download the profiles through alternative repository at http://go.imade3d.com/gcode-selection
